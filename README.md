# Historian

Your browsing history is complicated and using the history features that
come built in with your browser doesn't always give you what you want.

What if you wanted to visualize the sites that you visit the most and see how much time you spent there, or what sites you visit first thing in the morning, or find that thing that you saw on someone's facebook feed about walruses but have no idea where to start searching for.

Well, how about a personal historian, someone who can guide you through your browsing history and maybe even resurfacing things that you might have missed or suggesting things that you would like to see in the future?

I will be working on this project solo and using this README as a kind of running log and commentary about my thought processes and goals and stuff. If someone stumbles along this project and thinks they can make a contribution, please send pull requests or reach out to me to suggest new features.

I assume this README will get updated every time I push the repo, eventually I will find another place for these notes. But for now I want to put it in front of my face.

Initial Features and Goals:

- Chrome Extension / Web App / Cross-Platform App for Chrome / PWA
- Research if a web page has access to chrome's history api besides for extensions
- How does history work? Does it go by logged in Google User? Or just by the actual browser itself?
- What useful information would we like to appear to the user
  - top visited sites
  - most time spent
  - categories of videos, interactive, text, etc.
  - detect topics of interest and return stats for that
- How will data be stored? Will we send all history info to a server when a user authorizes/installs or visits page
- What is the MVP of this being useful to someone?
- How will we handle the authorization/permissions?
- How often will I contribute to this project?
- What technologies/libraries should be used?
